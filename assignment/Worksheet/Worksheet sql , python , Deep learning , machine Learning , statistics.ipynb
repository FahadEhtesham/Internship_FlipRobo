    "A convex optimization problem is a problem where all of the constraints are convex functions, and the objective is a convex function if minimizing, or a concave function if maximizing.  Linear functions are convex, so linear programming problems are convex problems.  Conic optimization problems -- the natural extension of linear programming problems are also convex problems.\n",

    "A non-convex optimization problem is any problem where the objective or any of the constraints are non-convex\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a problem may have multiple feasible regions and multiple locally optimal points within each region.  It can take time exponential in the number of variables and constraints to determine that a non-convex problem is infeasible, that the objective function is unbounded, or that an optimal solution is the \"global optimum\" across all feasible regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "12] In mathematics, a saddle point or minimax point is a point on the surface of the graph of a function where the slopes (derivatives) in orthogonal directions are all zero (a critical point), but which is not a local extremum of the function.An example of a saddle point is when there is a critical point with a relative minimum along one axial direction (between peaks) and at a relative maximum along the crossing axis. However, a saddle point need not be in this form. For example, the function {\\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{3}}{\\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{3}} has a critical point at {\\displaystyle (0,0)}(0,0) that is a saddle point since it is neither a relative maximum nor relative minimum, but it does not have a relative maximum or relative minimum in the {\\displaystyle y}y-direction.\n",
