    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is a probability function that describes how the values of a variable are distributed. It is a symmetric distribution where most of the observations cluster around the central peak and the probabilities for values further away from the mean taper off equally in both directions."

    "\n",
    "Using an A/B test gives you an idea of what delights your customers the most. For example, if you're using a promoted tweet campaign to support a new product launch, you might test different versions of that tweet using automated software, so you can tell how to market to your audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "After seeing which tweet had the most clicks, you can then use that version in marketing messages, as well as a template for the duration of the campaign. That way, engagement is more of a guarantee."
